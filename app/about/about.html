<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
	Hello my name is Matt Dyer.  I'm a developer and a web designer.  I have been a professional developer since 2004.  Most of my professional work has been with Coldfusion.  Over the years I have also become much more proficient in javascript.  Outside of my professional career I have worked in Java for applets and Android Apps.  I have also built sites with php, and done a little bit with Ruby on Rails.
